An important part of this course is reading research papers.  High-level synthesis is an active research area and many of the most interesting developments are taking place in the research domain.  In addition, reading and reviewing research papers is a good skill to practice, especially for those of you that go on to a research career.

## Paper Review Contents

Include the following in your paper review (in marked sections):
  1. A sentence or two giving an **overview** of the paper.
  1. Describe the **2-3 Major Contributions and/or Novelty** of the paper. This should be more than a re-statement of the abstract.  What do you think are the important contributions of the paper?
  1. Provide a **critical review, discussing several positive and negative aspects of the paper**.  Try to provide non-trivial arguments, including some points not brought up by the authors.  Do not summarize the paper (that's what the abstract is for); rather, evaluate the merits of the work done by the authors as presented in the paper. You could comment on things like: (not all in one review):
      *	importance of the problem being solved
      *	soundness/correctness of approach
      *	appropriateness of methodology
      * quality, completeness or repeatability of results
      *	readability
      *	perspective and/or comparison with previous work
  1. Identify at least one aspect of the paper that you **didn't understand**, or want to better understand.

Your review should be one page or less (normal fonts and margins).  Quality is more important than quantity.
